# Linear Control System

## Description
This repository contains materials and code related to the **Linear Control System** course, held by **Dr. Taghirad**. The project covers fundamental and advanced topics in linear control theory, including stability analysis, state-space representation, and controller design.

## Features
- State-space modeling of linear systems
- Stability analysis techniques
- Controller design (PID, state feedback, etc.)
- Simulation of control systems in MATLAB/Python
