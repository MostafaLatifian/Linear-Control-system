# Linear Control System

## Description
This repository contains materials and code related to the **Linear Control System** course, held by **Dr. Taghirad**. The project covers fundamental and advanced topics in linear control theory, including stability analysis, state-space representation, and controller design.

## Features
- State-space modeling of linear systems
- Stability analysis techniques
- Controller design (PID, state feedback, etc.)
- Simulation of control systems in MATLAB/Python

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/linear-control-system.git

# Change into the directory
cd linear-control-system

# Install dependencies (if applicable)
pip install -r requirements.txt  # For Python users
